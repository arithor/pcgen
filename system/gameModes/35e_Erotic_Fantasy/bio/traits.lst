[PHRASE]
...but I'm feeling MUCH better now.
A god was chasing me, so I ran.
A part of me is gone and it's never coming back.
A realy good place to bring your kids up.
Again with the finger!
Again?
Ah! My heart!
Am I a CLOWN?! Do I AMUSE YOU?!
Ancient Elven secret, huh?
And Knowing is half the battle
And who can stop us ???
Are you talking to me?
As you wish.
Beware of the dwarf.
Bite me!
Bring out your dead.
But you didn't tell me that I COULDN'T do that!
By this time my lungs were aching for air.
C'mon.I can use her in my act. Huzzah!
Complex problems have simple, easy to understand, wrong answers. 
Conform...conform...
Cut, it, out.
Damn you all to hell!
Dead people walking around get torched.
Deliver your speach. I promise not to slay you until you have finished it.
Did I do that?
Do not bring your evil here.
Don't MISS!
Don't worry, I have a plan...
Don't you do it!
Dying is easy, comedy is hard.
EAT HIM! HE'S BIGGER!
Emptiness feeds the hunger
Even without feet, I could kill you.
Everyone loves tar. Sure, who doesn't?
Evil doers beware!
Exterminate! Exterminate!
Feel The Power of The ultimate Warriorrrrrrrr!
Fifty Gold and time served
Get these spiders off me!
Go ahead, make my day.
Go to bed, old man!
Good night and may Gods bless!
Ha! I kill me!
Have mercy
He tamperred in God's domain.
Hey, I bet I can do that better than you can!
Hey. I wanted that bone marrow.
Hi ho. Hi ho. It's off to death we go.
How about a little fire?
How does this chair work?
How fortunate! This will simplify everything!
How much damage does a flaming thief do?
Hurts, don't it? Tell your friends.
Hush, child, you'll anger the overlords.
I WILL kill him!
I didn't mean to hit you with that web spell. Let me help I'll BURN it off!
I don't have any solution, but I certainly admire the problem. 
I don't know what it was, but it sure hurt like hell...
I don't know!
I don't understand!!
I got nowhere else to go!
I hate them because they kill my nice monsters. 
I hate when that happens
I hear you!
I just had one of my brillant ideas
I like you--that's why I'm going to kill you last.
I love it when a plan comes together
I regret nothing!
I smell a rat.
I suppose I'll knock him out with a rock, only... I'll use a soft rock, so it won't hurt that much.
I think I hear a giant sucking sound.
I want them dead!
I wonder what this does ?
I'll be back.
I'll give you a definite maybe. 
I'll harm you!
I'll hit you so hard your dog will yelp.
I'll take this away so you don't hurt yourself.
I'm destined for greatness in *everybody's* lifetime!
I'm going to go for violence, 'cause I know that works.
I'm huge!
I'm hysterical, and I'm wet, and I'm in pain!
I'm not dead yet!
I'm the god! I'M THE GOD!
If it jams, force it. If it breaks, it needed replacing anyway. 
If you cannot convince them, confuse them. 
If you don't understand it, it must be intuitively obvious. 
If you hit me and I find out about it...
If you think the problem is bad now, just wait until we've solved it. 
Inside every small problem is a large problem struggling to get out. 
Interesting--but STUPID!
Is it safe?
It is easier to get forgiveness than permission. 
It stinks!
It wasn't me!
It's hot and it hurts and stuff.
It's kind of fun to do the impossible. 
Let's Be Careful out there
Let's go do some crimes.
Let's ride.
Life is simple here.
Like father, like son. Think about it, won't you?
Live, dammit, live! You've never given up on anything in your life, now LIVE!"
Logic is a systematic method of coming to the wrong conclusion with confidence. 
My experience shows that 95% of all humans are morons.
My mother was a saint!
NOW IS THE HOUR OF YOUR DEATH! ...more or less.
Nice touch
No Problem!
No, you go first.
Not gonna do it!
Now it's garbage.
Now what were the words to that spell?
Now what, Boss?
Oh great. We are saved by the gates of Hell.
Oh my lord!!
Oh no, they're on to us. Quick! Get the fireball!
Oh where you talking to me?
Oh, for fun!
Oh, just do it; and don't screw it up this time!
Oh, may I?
Oh, suddenly *I'm* the jerk!
Oh, that! Nope, never saw it."
Oh, the humanity...
Oooops !!
Oops, sorry! That was me...
Pain is the healing.
Pray your gods who ask you for you blood. For they are ruthless punishers. 
Saaaaaaay!
Sample my fist you community theater reject!
Sanctuary!
Seeing that the criminal justice system was not defending my rights, I released myself into my own custody.
Something is wrong...
Sometimes it's so easy, I'm ashamed of myself
Sometimes the more you wonder why, the worse it seems to get.
Thank you very much
That's what I'm asking. I don't know!
The master wouldn't approve...
The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the DUMB! 
There is no problem so difficult that it cannot be solved by brute strength and ignorance. 
There is no time like the present for postponing what we ought to be doing. 
They wouldn't know subtlety if it painted itself purple and jumped up and down in front of them singing 'Subtlety is here again'...
Toss the halfling in.
Trust Me, I know what I'm doing
Turn it off! Turn it off!
Two Platinum! That's thirty Gold!
Underdark. I can't believe I'm still in the Underdark.
Wait a minute! You never said there was a monster here!
Wait! I'm a MASTER at unarmed combat!
Want some help?
Warriors, come out and play!
We need a distraction!
We're making progress. Things are getting worse at a slower rate. 
What could possibly harm the greatest swordsman time has ever seen?
What if they bag the evil?
What is it about the gates of Hell that compells people to walk through them?
Why are we here? We're here to loot and pillage!
Works every time.
Works for me
Would you like it regular or extra crispy?
Yoo hoo, mister golem! i'm cute don't hurt us!
You better not try to play any tricks on me, I've been fooled before!
You did it! You finally did it!
You have a nasty habit of surviving.
You have been weighed, measured and found wanting.
You have got to be kidding me!
You haven't seen the last of me.
You will bow down before me!
You'd better watch out! My FIVE POWERFUL FRIENDS will be coming through THAT DOOR any minute now!
You're gonna make it after all...
You're ruining it for me.
You've broken Orc law.
You... are going... to die! Because I... am going... to KILL you!
